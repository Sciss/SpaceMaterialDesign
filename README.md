# Space Material Detail

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sciss/SpaceMaterialDetail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sciss/SpaceMaterialDetail)

## statement

This is a project to accompany the workshop [Space Material Detail](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/595459/595460),
a collaboration between the European Master Module in Art, Science and Technology (MAST) with the artistic research
project Algorithms that Matter. This project _generates_ a workspace for [Mellite](https://sciss.de/mellite), 
containing a number of experimental _FScape_ modules available to the workshop.

This code base _produces a Mellite workspace_ with various FScape modules. These modules are made available under
the the [CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 Intl](https://git.iem.at/sciss/SpaceMaterialDetail/blob/master/LICENSE-workspace) license.
This basically means we can derive your own FScape modules from the provided code, but if you share them, follow the
rules of the license (attribution and sharing under the same conditions.)

If you produce any _artifacts_ with the modules, such as sound files, images etc., I do not reserve any rights to them.
You are thus free to use any generated materials from the modules in your artworks as you please.
